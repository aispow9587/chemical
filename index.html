Kinetics</strong></h1>

<p></p>

<p>Hi! My name is Aisbel. This is a Work in Progress about Chemical
Kinetics.</p>

<p></p>

<p><em><strong>Chemical kinetics</strong></em>, also known as reaction
kinetics, is the branch of physical chemistry that is concerned with
understanding the rates of chemical reactions. It is to be contrasted with
thermodynamics, which deals with the direction in which a process occurs but in
itself tells nothing about its rate. </p>

<p>Chemical kinetics includes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Investigations of how experimental conditions influence the speed of a
    chemical reaction</li>
  <li>Yield information about the reaction's mechanism and transition
  states</li>
  <li>Construction of mathematical models that also can describe the
    characteristics of a chemical reaction. </li>
</ol>

<p>In 1864, Peter Waage and Cato Guldberg pioneered the development of chemical
kinetics by formulating the <em><strong>law of mass action</strong></em>, which
states that the speed of a chemical reaction is proportional to the quantity of
the reacting substances.</p>

affecting reaction rate</h2>

<p></p>

<h4>Nature of the reactants</h4>

<p>The reaction rate varies depending upon what substances are reacting.
Acid/base reactions, the formation of salts, and ion exchange are usually fast
reactions. When covalent bond formation takes place between the molecules and
when large molecules are formed, the reactions tend to be slower. The nature
and strength of bonds in reactant molecules greatly influence the rate of their
transformation into products. </p>

<p></p>

<h4>Physical state</h4>

<p>The physical state (solid, liquid, or gas) of a reactant is also an
important factor of the rate of change. When reactants are in the same phase,
as in aqueous solution, thermal motion brings them into contact. However, when
they are in separate phases, the reaction is limited to the interface between
the reactants. Reaction can occur only at their area of contact; in the case of
a liquid and a gas, at the surface of the liquid. </p>

<p>Vigorous shaking and stirring may be needed to bring the reaction to
completion. This means that the more finely divided a solid or liquid reactant
the greater its surface area per unit volume and the more contact it with the
other reactant, thus the faster the reaction. </p>

<p>To make an analogy, for example, when one starts a fire, one uses wood chips
and small branches &#x2014; one does not start with large logs right away. In
organic chemistry, on water reactions are the exception to the rule that
homogeneous reactions take place faster than heterogeneous reactions ( are
those reactions in which solute and solvent not mix properly).</p>

<p></p>

<h4>Surface area of solid state</h4>

<p>In a solid, only those particles that are at the surface can be involved in
a reaction. Crushing a solid into smaller parts means that more particles are
present at the surface, and the frequency of collisions between these and
reactant particles increases, and so reaction occurs more rapidly. <img

<p>For example, Sherbet (powder) is a mixture of very fine powder of malic acid
(a weak organic acid) and sodium hydrogen carbonate. On contact with the saliva
in the mouth, these chemicals quickly dissolve and react, releasing carbon
dioxide and providing for the fizzy sensation. </p>

<p>Also, fireworks manufacturers modify the surface area of solid reactants to
control the rate at which the fuels in fireworks are oxidised, using this to
create diverse effects. </p>

<p>For example, finely divided aluminium confined in a shell explodes
violently. If larger pieces of aluminium are used, the reaction is slower and
sparks are seen as pieces of burning metal are ejected. </p>

<p></p>

<h4>Concentration</h4>

<p></p>

<p>The reactions are due to collisions of reactant species. The frequency with
which the molecules or ions collide depends upon their concentrations. The more
crowded the molecules are, the more likely they are to collide and react with
one another. Thus, an increase in the concentrations of the reactants will
usually result in the corresponding increase in the reaction rate, while a
decrease in the concentrations will usually have a reverse effect. For example,
combustion will occur more rapidly in pure oxygen than in air (21% oxygen).</p>

<p>The rate equation shows the detailed dependence of the reaction rate on the
concentrations of reactants and other species present. The mathematical forms
depend on the reaction mechanism. The actual rate equation for a given reaction
is determined experimentally and provides information about the reaction
mechanism. </p>

<p></p>

<h4>Temperature</h4>

<p>Temperature usually has a major effect on the rate of a chemical reaction.
Molecules at a higher temperature have more thermal energy. Although collision
frequency is greater at higher temperatures, this alone contributes only a very
small proportion to the increase in rate of reaction. Much more important is
the fact that the proportion of reactant molecules with sufficient energy to
react (energy greater than activation energy: E &gt; Ea) is significantly
higher and is explained in detail by the Maxwell&#x2013;Boltzmann distribution
of molecular energies.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The effect of temperature on the rate of chemical reaction:</p>

<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>Under certain temperature, chemical rate of a reaction depends on the
    value of the A-factor, the magnitude of the activation energy, and the
    concentrations of the reactants. usually, rapid reactions are caused by
    relatively smaller activation energies.</li>
  <li>The 'rule of thumb' that the rate of chemical reactions doubles for every
    10 °C temperature rise is a common misconception. This may have been
    generalized from the special case of biological systems, where the &#x3b1;
    (temperature coefficient) is often between 1.5 and 2.5.</li>
  <li>A reaction's kinetics can also be studied with a temperature jump
    approach. This involves using a sharp rise in temperature and observing the
    relaxation time of the return to equilibrium. A particularly useful form of
    temperature jump apparatus is a shock tube, which can rapidly jump a gas's
    temperature by more than 1000 degrees. </li>
